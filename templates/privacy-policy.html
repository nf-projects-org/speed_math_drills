<p><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>

<p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Cookies</strong></p>

<p>You can change your cookie preferences any time from the settings page <a class="link-light" href="https://speedmathsdrills.com/accounts/settings">here</a>. This will let you revisit the cookie consent banner and change your preferences or withdraw your consent right away.</p>

</li>

<li>
    <p>Login related cookies</p>
