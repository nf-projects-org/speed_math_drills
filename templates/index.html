    <p>I don't need to tell you that it's all about speed. You already know that every second you save here means you have more time for the tricky questions.
        It's a matter of life and death. Yeah, that's a little too strong. It's the difference between a good college and a great college. It's the difference between getting into the B-School you want this time, or having to wait another year before you can try again. Trust me, you want it done this time.</p>

  <div class="col-10 col-sm-10 col-md-8 p-0 text-start">
    <p>I don't need to tell you that it's all about practice, do I? You already know that too. When you practice frequently, your brain will wrap your neural circuits with myelin, again and again, making your better and faster each time, until you're not thinking about doing it, but just doing it!</p>
    <p>That is the end goal. Getting fast and accurate with your calculations, saving time, conserving your mental energy, acing the test and getting into your college.</p>
